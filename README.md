# Extend Istio application to connect to external service(s) by configuring egress policies and test canary deployments

[Istio](http://istio.io) is an open platform that provides a uniform way to connect, manage, and secure microservices. Istio is the result of a joint collaboration between IBM, Google and Lyft as a means to support traffic flow management, access policy enforcement and the telemetry data aggregation between microservices, all without requiring changes to the code of your microservice. Istio provides an easy way to create this service mesh by deploying a [control plane](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/overview.html#architecture) and injecting sidecars, an extended version of the  [Envoy](https://lyft.github.io/envoy/) proxy, in the same Pod as your microservice.

The [BookInfo](https://istio.io/docs/samples/bookinfo.html) is a simple application that is composed of four microservices. The application is written in different languages for each of its microservices namely Python, Java, Ruby, and Node.js.

In this code we show how we can deploy Istio framework and sample application, and then focus on how can we enable and modify application to connect to external service(s) by configuring egress policies on Envoy sidecars. We then show version based routing and deployments, and perform request tracing.

[Part B: Configure traffic flow management, access policy and telemetry data aggregation for application](#part-b-configure-traffic-flow-management-access-policy-and-telemetry-data-aggregation-for-application)

# Prerequisite
Create a Kubernetes cluster with either [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube) for local testing, or with [IBM Bluemix Container Service](https://github.com/IBM/container-journey-template/blob/master/Toolchain_Instructions_new.md) to deploy in cloud. The code here is regularly tested against [Kubernetes Cluster from Bluemix Container Service](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_ov.html#cs_ov) using Travis.

You will also need Istio service mesh installed on top of your Kubernetes cluster. Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/IBM/Microservices-with-Istio-Service-Mesh-on-Kubernetes/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md) to get Istio mesh installed on Kubernetes, and try out the [sample bookinfo application](https://github.com/IBM/Microservices-with-Istio-Service-Mesh-on-Kubernetes/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md#2-deploy-sample-bookinfo-application-on-kubernetes) to verify.

# Deploy to Bluemix
If you want to deploy the BookInfo app directly to Bluemix, click on 'Deploy to Bluemix' button below to create a Bluemix DevOps service toolchain and pipeline for deploying the sample, else jump to [Steps](#steps)

> You will need to create your Kubernetes cluster first and make sure it is fully deployed in your Bluemix account.

#### [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting-1)

# Part A: Modify Istio application to connect to external datasource by rebuilding microservices and enabling egress traffic

#### Clone this repository. This step requires you to use the YAML files and/or source code for the microservices.

# 1. Create an external datasource for application

### 1.1 Create MySQL Database in a container
Using a MySQL Database in a container in the same as your application's cluster would mean that you would not need to enable egress traffic as it is in the same network or IP range with the Istio-enabled application. The source code for the Docker image used in creating a MySQL Database is in the [microservices folder](/microservices). The image also adds initial data that will be used later in the application.  
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f book-database.yaml)
```

### 1.2 Create Compose for MySQL Database in Bluemix
Provision Compose for MySQL in Bluemix via https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/compose-for-mysql  
Go to Service credentials and view your credentials. Your MySQL hostname, port, user, and password are under your credential uri and it should look like this
![images](images/mysqlservice.png)

## 2. Modify sample application to use the external database

In this step, you can choose to build your Docker images from source in the [microservices folder](/microservices) or use the given images.  
> For building your own images, go to [microservices folder](/microservices)

The original [Sample BookInfo Application](https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/master/samples/apps/bookinfo/src) was modified in this journey to leverage a MySQL database. The modified microservices are the `details`, `ratings`, and `reviews`. The **details microservice** is using Ruby and a `mysql` ruby gem was added to connect to a MySQL database. The **ratings microservice** is using Node.js and a `mysql` module was added to connect to a MySQL database. The **reviews v1,v2,v3 microservices** is using Java and a `mysql-connector-java` dependency was added in [build.gradle](/microservices/reviews/reviews-application/build.gradle) to connect to a MySQL database. More source code was added to [details.rb](/microservices/details/details.rb), [ratings.js](/microservices/ratings/ratings.js), [LibertyRestEndpoint.java](/microservices/reviews/reviews-application/src/main/java/application/rest/LibertyRestEndpoint.java) that enables the application to use the details, ratings, and reviews data from the MySQL Database.  
Preview of added source code for `ratings.js` for connecting to MySQL database:
![ratings_diff](images/ratings_diff.png)


The YAML files you need to modify are:  
* `details-new.yaml`
* `reviews-new.yaml`
* `ratings-new.yaml`
* `mysql-data.yaml` _Not needed if you are using [1.1 MySQL in a container](#11-create-mysql-database-in-a-container) of your cluster_
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  ...
    image: ## <insert the corresponding image name you built>
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    env: ## CHANGE THESE VALUES TO YOUR MYSQL DATABASE CREDENTIALS
    - name: MYSQL_DB_USER
      value: 'PLACEHOLDER_DB_USER'
    - name: MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD
      value: 'PLACEHOLDER_DB_PASSWORD'
    - name: MYSQL_DB_HOST
      value: 'PLACEHOLDER_DB_HOST'
    - name: MYSQL_DB_PORT
      value: 'PLACEHOLDER_DB_PORT'
    ...
```

## 3. Deploy application microservices and Istio envoys with Egress traffic enabled

* Insert data in your MySQL database in Bluemix. **NOTE:** _If you are running a [1.1 MySQL in a container](#11-create-mysql-database-in-a-container) of your cluster, you would not need to do this as the initial data is already deployed with the image_
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f mysql-data.yaml --includeIPRanges=172.30.0.0/16,172.20.0.0/16)
```
The `--includeIPRanges` option is to pass the IP range(s) used for internal cluster services, thereby excluding external IPs from being redirected to the sidecar proxy. The IP range above is for IBM Bluemix provisioned Kubernetes Clusters. For minikube, you will have to use `10.0.0.1/24`
> IMPORTANT NOTE: You don't need to add `--includeIPRanges` parameter if you are using a [1.1 MySQL in a container](#11-create-mysql-database-in-a-container). However, for services otuside of your cluster, you would need to enable egress traffic and add `--includeIPRanges` if it is not an http/https protocol. You can read more about enabling egress traffic for http/https protocol [here](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/egress.html#using-the-istio-egress-service)

* Deploy `productpage` with Envoy injection and `gateway`.  
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f bookinfo.yaml)
```
The `productpage` is not expecting to have egress traffic so you would not need to configure the Envoy to intercept external requests.

* Deploy `details` with Envoy injection and Egress traffic enabled.  
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f details-new.yaml --includeIPRanges=172.30.0.0/16,172.20.0.0/16)
```
* Deploy `reviews` with Envoy injection and Egress traffic enabled.  
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f reviews-new.yaml --includeIPRanges=172.30.0.0/16,172.20.0.0/16)
```
* Deploy `ratings` with Envoy injection and Egress traffic enabled.  
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f ratings-new.yaml --includeIPRanges=172.30.0.0/16,172.20.0.0/16)
```

The `details`, `reviews`, `ratings` will have external traffic since your MySQL database is outside of your cluster. That is why you would need to use `--includeIPRanges` option in `istioctl kube-inject`.

You can now access your application to confirm that it is getting data from your MySQL database.
```bash
echo $(kubectl get po -l istio=ingress -o jsonpath={.items[0].status.hostIP}):$(kubectl get svc istio-ingress -o jsonpath={.spec.ports[0].nodePort})
184.xxx.yyy.zzz:30XYZ
```

Point your browser to:  
`http://184.xxx.yyy.zzz:30XYZ/productpage` Replace with your own IP and NodePort.



[Enabling Egress Traffic on Istio](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/egress.html)

# Part B:  Configure traffic flow management, access policy and telemetry data aggregation for application

#### You would need to be in the root directory of the [Istio release](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/installing-istio.html) you have downloaded on the [Prerequisites](#prerequisite) section.

## 4. Traffic flow management - Modify service routes

This step shows you how to configure where you want your service to go based on weights and HTTP Headers.
* Set Default Routes to `reviews-v1` for all microservices  
This would set all incoming routes on the services (indicated in the line `destination: <service>`) to the deployment with a tag `version: v1`. To set the default routes, run:
  ```bash
  $ istioctl create -f samples/apps/bookinfo/route-rule-all-v1.yaml
  ```
* Set Route to `reviews-v2` of **reviews microservice** for a specific user  
This would set the route for the user `jason` (You can login as _jason_ with any password in your deploy web application) to see the `version: v2` of the reviews microservice. Run:
  ```bash
  $ istioctl create -f samples/apps/bookinfo/route-rule-reviews-test-v2.yaml
  ```
* Route 50% of traffic on **reviews microservice** to `reviews-v1` and 50% to `reviews-v3`.  
This is indicated by the `weight: 50` in the yaml file.
  ```bash
  $ istioctl replace -f samples/apps/bookinfo/route-rule-reviews-50-v3.yaml
  # using `replace` should allow you to edit exisiting route-rules.
  ```
* Route 100% of the traffic to the `version: v3` of the **reviews microservices**  
This would set every incoming traffic to the version v3 of the reviews microservice. Run:
  ```bash
  $ istioctl replace -f samples/apps/bookinfo/route-rule-reviews-v3.yaml
  ```

## 5. Access policy enforcement - Configure access control

This step shows you how to control access to your services. If you have done the step above, you'll see that your `productpage` now just shows red stars on the reviews section and if you are logged in as _jason_, you'll see black stars. The `ratings` service is accessed from the `reviews-v2` if you're logged in as _jason_ or it is accessed from `reviews-v3` if you are not logged in as `jason`.

* To deny access to the ratings service from the traffic coming from `reviews-v3`, you will use `istioctl mixer rule create`
  ```bash
  $ istioctl mixer rule create global ratings.default.svc.cluster.local -f samples/apps/bookinfo/mixer-rule-ratings-denial.yaml
  ```
  The `mixer-rule-ratings-denial.yaml` file creates a rule that denies `kind: denials` access from reviews service and has a label of v3 `selector: source.labels["app"]=="reviews" && source.labels["version"] == "v3"`  
  You can verify using `istioctl mixer rule get global ratings.default.svc.cluster.local` if the mixer rule has been created that way:
  ```yaml
  $ istioctl mixer rule get global ratings.default.svc.cluster.local
  rules:
  - aspects:
    - kind: denials
    selector: source.labels["app"]=="reviews" && source.labels["version"] == "v3"
  ```
* To verify if your rule has been enforced, point your browser to your BookInfo Application, you wouldn't see star ratings anymore from the reviews section unless you are logged in as _jason_ which you will still see black stars (because you would be using the reviews-v2 as you have done in [Step 4](#4-modify-service-routes)).
![access-control](images/access.png)


## 6. Telemetry data aggregation - Collect metrics, logs and trace spans

### 6.1 Collect metrics and logs using Prometheus and Grafana

This step shows you how to configure [Istio Mixer](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/policy-and-control/mixer.html) to gather telemetry for services in your cluster.

* Install the required Istio Addons on your cluster: [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com)
  ```bash
  $ kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/addons/prometheus.yaml
  $ kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/addons/grafana.yaml
  ```
* Verify that your **Grafana** dashboard is ready. Get the IP of your cluster `kubectl get nodes` and then the NodePort of your Grafana service `kubectl get svc | grep grafana` or you can run the following command to output both:
  ```bash
  $ echo $(kubectl get po -l app=grafana -o jsonpath={.items[0].status.hostIP}):$(kubectl get svc grafana -o jsonpath={.spec.ports[0].nodePort})
  184.xxx.yyy.zzz:30XYZ
  ```
  Point your browser to `184.xxx.yyy.zzz:30XYZ/dashboard/db/istio-dashboard` to go directly to your dashboard.  
  Your dashboard should look like this:  
  ![Grafana-Dashboard](images/grafana.png)

* To collect new telemetry data, you will use `istio mixer rule create`. For this sample, you will generate logs for Response Size for Reviews service. The configuration YAML file is provided within the BookInfo sample folder. Validate that your Reviews service has no service-specific rules already applied.
  ```bash
  $ istioctl mixer rule get reviews.default.svc.cluster.local reviews.default.svc.cluster.local
  Error: the server could not find the requested resource
  ```
* Create a configuration YAML file and name it as `new_rule.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  revision: "1"
  rules:
  - aspects:
    - adapter: prometheus
      kind: metrics
      params:
        metrics:
        - descriptor_name: response_size
          value: response.size | 0
          labels:
            source: source.labels["app"] | "unknown"
            target: target.service | "unknown"
            service: target.labels["app"] | "unknown"
            version: target.labels["version"] | "unknown"
            method: request.path | "unknown"
            response_code: response.code | 200
    - adapter: default
      kind: access-logs
      params:
        logName: combined_log
        log:
          descriptor_name: accesslog.combined
          template_expressions:
            originIp: origin.ip
            sourceUser: origin.user
            timestamp: request.time
            method: request.method
            url: request.path
            protocol: request.scheme
            responseCode: response.code
            responseSize: response.size
            referer: request.referer
            userAgent: request.headers["user-agent"]
          labels:
            originIp: origin.ip
            sourceUser: origin.user
            timestamp: request.time
            method: request.method
            url: request.path
            protocol: request.scheme
            responseCode: response.code
            responseSize: response.size
            referer: request.referer
            userAgent: request.headers["user-agent"]
  ```
* Create the configuration on Istio Mixer.
  ```bash
  istioctl mixer rule create reviews.default.svc.cluster.local reviews.default.svc.cluster.local -f new_rule.yaml
  ```
* Send traffic to that service by refreshing your browser to `http://184.xxx.yyy.zzz:30XYZ/productpage` multiple times. You can also do `curl` on your terminal to that URL in a while loop.

* Verify that the new metric is being collected by going to your Grafana dashboard again. The graph on the rightmost should now be populated.
![grafana-new-metric](images/grafana-new-metric.png)

* Verify that the logs stream has been created and is being populated for requests
  ```bash
  $ kubectl logs $(kubectl get pods -l istio=mixer -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') | grep \"combined_log\"
  {"logName":"combined_log","labels":{"referer":"","responseSize":871,"timestamp":"2017-04-29T02:11:54.989466058Z","url":"/reviews","userAgent":"python-requests/2.11.1"},"textPayload":"- - - [29/Apr/2017:02:11:54 +0000] \"- /reviews -\" - 871 - python-requests/2.11.1"}
  ...
  ...
  ...
  ```

[Collecting Metrics and Logs on Istio](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/metrics-logs.html)

### 6.2 Collect request traces using Zipkin

This step shows you how to collect trace spans using [Zipkin](http://zipkin.io).
* Install the required Istio Addon: [Zipkin](http://zipkin.io)
  ```bash
  $ kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/addons/zipkin.yaml
  ```
* Access your **Zipkin Dashboard**. Get the IP of your cluster `kubectl get nodes` and then the NodePort of your Zipkin service `kubectl get svc | grep zipkin` or you can run the following command to output both:
  ```bash
  $ echo $(kubectl get po -l app=zipkin -o jsonpath={.items[0].status.hostIP}):$(kubectl get svc zipkin -o jsonpath={.spec.ports[0].nodePort})
  184.xxx.yyy.zzz:30XYZ
  ```  
  Your dashboard should like this:
  ![zipkin](images/zipkin.png)

* Send traffic to that service by refreshing your browser to `http://184.xxx.yyy.zzz:30XYZ/productpage` multiple times. You can also do `curl` on your terminal to that URL in a while loop.

* Go to your Zipkin Dashboard again and you will see a number of traces done. _Click on Find Traces button with the appropriate Start and End Time_
![zipkin](images/zipkin-traces.png)
* Click on one of those traces and you will see the details of the traffic you sent to your BookInfo App. It shows how much time it took for the request on `productpage` to finish. It also shows how much time it took for the requests on the `details`,`reviews`, and `ratings` services.
